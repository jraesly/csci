Kasanko 2006:
	This article talked about the urban sprawl or urban dispersion through 15 different cities in Southern, Middle/Western, and Northern Europe. Their study included data from the 1950's to the 1990's. They found that most of the growth occured during the 1950's-1960's and has slowed down to about 0.75% in the 1990's. I think the article was well presented. They provided a lot of graphs and tables to show their findings. They only studied 15 cities which I do not think is enough to have a conclusive arguement about urban sprawl in the whole continent of Europe. I find this topic interesting though because urban sprawl is talked a lot about in American history and I had this view that Europe was very compact and did not have much urban sprawl at all. 

Crandall 2009:
	This article investigated geotagged photos from Flickr and used their geospatial information to produce a structure that can be directly integrated with visual and textual-tag content for creating a global-scale photo collection. They also presented techniques to identify interesting places for people to visit in both city and landmarks. I think they presented their data well enough to prove what they were trying to accomplish. I think their methods were solid in choosing how each landmark would be considered the top one. It was in theory I believe a fairly simple concept. I think these methods would be very useful commercially for cities to improve their tourists numbers especially in places like Hawaii because they could use the findings and for commercials on TV they could show those places so people would want to visit more.
