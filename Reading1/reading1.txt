The main point of the article is to examine the relationship between black, low-income areas and fast-food. I think it was well presented and was fairly easy to follow along with. I think they took into account all possible factors with the 1 mile and 0.5 mile buffers. The article brings up a pretty controversial issue because of the availability of “healthy” foods in low income areas. Although this study is accurate, today I know that Whole Foods are popping up in many diverse areas nowadays.

The main point of this article was to examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent crimes and whether it is contingent upon specific neighborhood context. This article was much harder for me to follow along with mostly because of the terms that I did not understand and the models were presented in a way that I am not used to.
