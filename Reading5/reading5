Hengl 2014:
Their reasearch was about providing a new consistent soil information system, called SoilGrids1km. This new system provids a new set of soil spatial data at a resolution and consistency that was not previously available. I did not previously know about these type of information systems so for me this article presented itself in a way that showed me what a good soil information system would be. Their website looks very thorough and consistent which is one thing they really stressed.


Lark 2002:
This article was about optimizing the configuration of sample sites for estimation of the variogram by using the method of maximum likelihood. They used Spatial Simulated Annealing for optimization. They found that the most beneficial way of using the technique is for supplementing simple systematic designs that provide an initial estimate of the variogram. This article was very indepth in explaining its methods and its graphs. To me at first glance it would seem that the Hengl article came first but obviously that is not true.
