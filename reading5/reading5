Krigie 2005:
This article was about ore valuations in the mining field and how it presented a new field for geostatistical contributions. Some models included the lognormal model. It basically also contributed the first application of kriging including variance and other geostatistics. It was a very interesting article because it didn't seem to have an investigative purpose but more of just the history of geostatistics. Because of this there weren't really methods introduced and just how certain aspects of geostatistics came to be. I always find it very interesting to find out how things came to be and their origins versus just knowing the formulas for certain applications because it can help understand the concepts of the formulas better which in turn can be useful if you want to apply these formulas.


Wellens 2009:

This article was about finding an efficient way to describe spatial use. Specifically they wanted to exploit unused radio spectrum nodes of DSA networks monitor the spectrum around them because the radios can benefit from spatial characterization. They have two approaches to spatial modeling, one was an empirical approach that exploited passive measurements of the spectrum use and a deterministic approach based on a system model of the complete radio environment. They examined mostly the impact of different network properties for each model and particularly in wireless networks. I felt as if their methods were well presented along with the rest of the article. They left other aspects out for spectrum modelling which leads to further investigation.
