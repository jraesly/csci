Peters 2006:
The article talked about how diet influences environmental impact and how to feed more people with respect to land use. I think they presented the material very well and used a good base of comparison. The comparison I am talking about is the USDA's food pyramid and how they made each of the 42 different diets as equivalent as possible. One thing that bothered me was the fact that they brought up some comparisons, but would not have data to show and it would just be stated. I think this article shows ideas that can be considered facts based upon their findings that are contrary to popular belief. And although these finding seem good for meat eaters, they do not comply with the average American's daily consumption of meat.

The main point of this article was about accessibility of healthy food options in proximity to low-income areas specifically in Lansing, Michigan.The article mostly talked about what other studies did wrong versus what they actually did for theirs I felt. I think they presented everything very well and it was an easy read, but still they could have focused more on their own statistics with more graphs.
