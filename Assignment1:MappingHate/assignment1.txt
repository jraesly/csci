1. Yes there does seem to be a "sweet" spot vis a vis the size of racial majority. When a population is between 60%-85% white there is a larger KKK prevalence.

2. For hate groups in zips where the racial spread has a simple majority and not above 66% majority specifically for % white, the prevelance seems to rise dramatically and then starts to drop/level off as the majority grows.

3. Yes, as the prevelance increases the population drops.

4. Hate groups are more prevalent in zipcodes with lower sqmi. See sqmi.pdf.

5. As hate group prevalence increases the population decreases and as the Population increases the Employment Status stays fairly the same. See econ.pdf and econ1.pdf.

6. The population of 18-24 years old seems to have a larger percentage of people with a High School degree or higher whereas the age increases the less amount of people have a high school degree or higher. As hate group prevalence is higher in lower populations, that population spectrum is consistent with the amount of people with a high school degree or higher.
